# autocomplete_using_TRIE_DS
mini project

TRIE:

1.TRIE data structure is an efficient data structure used to search a word in the database of words
2.It reduces the total time complexity to search the word .The time complexity of TRIE data structure is O(length of the key searched).
3.When using normal search operations the time complexity to search a word will be O(length of total search words int the database).

ABOUT PROJECT:

1.In this project we build a search box using trie data structure.
2.It also contains a button "INSERT" to insert any new word to the database file.
3.the search box displays all the possible words present in the database file starting with the prefix of the searched key word.
